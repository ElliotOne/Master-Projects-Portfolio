/*
	In concurrent systems, composing different processes and checking the behavior of the combined system is a 
	standard method to ensure that each individual process aligns with the expected overall behavior.
	Assuming that Sbehaviour contains only determistic choices, to check the Sbehaviour with the solution for Q1,
	one can simply compose the Sbehaviour with S (the composition of NS and WE). If the composition 
	"Sbehaviour || S" functions as expected without any issues such as deadlocks or unxpected behaviors, then
	it shows that the provided solution is correct. In contrast, if there are issues in the composed system,
	it indicates discrepancies between Sbehaviour and the provided solution.
