Q2. a:
	This modeling language does not specify the probabilities, only possibilities. However, since the 
	"coffee" action is associated with the "red" button, therefore, its probability is equivalent to the
    probability of pressing the red button. The model is deterministic, meaning there is precisely one
	possible next state for any given state. As explicit probabilities for each transition are not provided,
	we assume eaqual probability for each. Therefore, the probability of performing the "coffee" action is 1/3
	or approximately 33.33%, given three equally likely buttons.

Q2. b:
	Once the green button is pressed in the FSP model, the process to produce tea begins. This includes the time
	required for the "intern1" and "tea" actions to complete, as per the sequence defined in the model. However, the model does not
	specify the exact duration for "intern1" and "tea" or the overall time to produce tea, so any precise time estimation remains
	speculative. The duration can only be inferred to be at least as long as the "intern1" action.
